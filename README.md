## Installation 
Requirements:
- Go 1.22.3 or later
- Git
- Database client (MySQL/PostgreSQL) installed
- Discord webhook URL for notifications

### Step 1: Clone the repository
Git clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
    git clone  https://github.com/sambasivareddy-ch/db_backup_utility.git
```
### Step 2: Change directory
```bash
    cd db_backup_utility
```
### Step 3: Install dependencies
```bash
    go mod tidy
```
### Step 4: Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Discord webhook URL:
```bash
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_webhook_url
```
### Step 5: Build the project
```bash
    go build -o db_backup_utility main.go
```
or 
```bash
    go build -o db_backup_utility .
```

## Usage 
### Get help
To get help on how to use the utility, run the following command:
```bash
    ./db_backup_utility help
```
### Configure the utility
To configure the utility with necessary database connection details and backup directory details 
```bash
    ./db_backup_utility config
```
It will prompt you to enter the following details:
- Database type (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Database host
- Database port
- Database name
- Database user
- Database password
- Backup directory
### Backup a database
To backup a database, run the following command:
```bash
    ./db_backup_utility backup
```
This will create a backup of the specified database and save it in the configured backup directory.
In case of MySQL, it will create a `mysql_backup_<backup_time>.sql` file with the backup.
In case of PostgreSQL, it will create a `pg_backup_<backup_time>.dump` file with the backup.
### Restore a database
To restore a database from a backup, run the following command:
```bash
    ./db_backup_utility restore
```
This will prompt you with list of available backups in the configured backup directory.
You can select a backup file to restore the database.
### Schedule backups
To schedule backups using cron jobs, you can use the following command:
```bash
    ./db_backup_utility schedule -c <cron_expression> -o <operation>
```
Replace `<cron_expression>` with the desired cron expression (e.g., `0 2 * * *` for daily backups at 2 AM) and `<operation>` with either `backup` or `restore`.
